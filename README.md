# ris API wrapper in Python

A wrapper for the [ris API](https://data.bka.gv.at/ris/api/v2.5/Help) in Python.

Still work in progress. Until now the wrapper only concerns decisions by judicial bodies.

The benefits of this wrapper will be:
- argument validation to make sure you receive what you want
- proper error handling to deal with known issues of the api
- return data in a sensible structure
- sort your results as you like
